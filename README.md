## About

ExcelMarketer is an Excel Spreadsheet that uses CCP's newest Excel plugin to pull market data and display them without having to log in.

Inspiration comes from [EVEMarketer](https://evemarketer.com/) by [@aplulu_cat](https://twitter.com/aplulu_cat)

Uses data from [Steve Ronuken's](https://github.com/fuzzysteve) [fuzzwork SDE dump](https://www.fuzzwork.co.uk/dump/)

## Why did you make this if EVEMarketer exists?

While EVEMarketer is still technically up and running, its SDE has not been updated since Version 19.11 in 2021 and is dependent on server hosting. This means it can go down (which happens occasionally) and if aplulu chooses, it may go down permanently. I made ExcelMarketer so that anyone has a chance to look at in-game market orders without having to rely on third-party online websites, and designed it so that updating the SDE is relatively simple. The only third-party tool this relies on is Fuzzwork's SDE dumps which is very reliable.

As it stands, until invTypes.csv's format changes or CCP pulls the plug on the Excel plugin, this spreadsheet should work for a good while as long as you follow the instructions tab on updating the item list.
