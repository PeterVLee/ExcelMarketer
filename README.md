## About

ExcelMarketer is an Excel Spreadsheet that uses CCP's newest Excel plugin to pull market data and display them without having to log in, created by baseLine (C-tier """developer""")

Inspiration comes from [EVEMarketer](https://evemarketer.com/) by [@aplulu_cat](https://twitter.com/aplulu_cat)

Uses data from [Steve Ronuken's](https://github.com/fuzzysteve) [fuzzwork SDE dump](https://www.fuzzwork.co.uk/dump/)

## What is this horrible monstrosity and why did you make it?

While EVEMarketer is still technically up and running, its SDE has not been updated in a while and is dependent on server hosting. This means it can go down (which happens occasionally) and if aplulu chooses, it may go down permanently. I made ExcelMarketer so that anyone has a chance to look at in-game market orders without having to rely on third-party online websites, and designed it so that updating the SDE is relatively simple. Of course, this also assumes fuzzwork doesn't go down but we'll ignore that for now.

Until invTypes.csv's format changes or CCP pulls the plug on the excel plugin, this spreadsheet should work for a good while as long as you follow the instructions tab on updating the item list. I eventually plan on making a macro to update it automatically and make this even more user friendly.
