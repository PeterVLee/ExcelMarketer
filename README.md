## About

ExcelMarketer is an Excel Spreadsheet that uses CCP's newest Excel plugin to pull market data and display them without having to log in.

EVEMarketer has been shut down, so I made this so that anyone has a chance to look at in-game market orders without having to rely on third-party online websites, and designed it so that updating the SDE is relatively simple. The only third-party tool this relies on is Fuzzwork's SDE dumps which are very reliable.

Inspiration comes from [EVEMarketer](https://evemarketer.com/) by [@aplulu_cat](https://twitter.com/aplulu_cat)

Uses data from [Steve Ronuken's](https://github.com/fuzzysteve) [fuzzwork SDE dump](https://www.fuzzwork.co.uk/dump/)

As it stands, until the SDE format changes or CCP pulls the plug on the Excel plugin, this spreadsheet should work for a good while as long as you follow the instructions tab on updating the item list.
